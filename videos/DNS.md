Title: I punished them for stealing my data (legally)

[AT&T support thread]
So I got ATT fiber and performance is great but it doesn't let me change the DNS servers in the router. I have to use.

This is bad because not only would they be able to sell all my actual network traffic but also have every website that traffic is associated with.

So I had to start using a VPN and change the DNS settings on all my devices.

And because they made me do that, I made a script which sends a lot of randomly generated DNS requests to the servers they tried to shove down my throat.

This way they can still try to sell my data but anyone who looks at it would be able to tell that it's garbage.

If you live in the US, your internet service provider can legally track you and sell your browsing history to anyone.

One of the ways they do this is by making you use their DNS servers -- that way they can get a list of all the sites you visit

[recording script running on server]
So I just made a script that sends them fake DNS requests and route my actual traffic through my server in Europe.

Hopefully this obviously bogus data won't sell for as much.
