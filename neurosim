ChannelValueType: variant<bool | int | float | etc.>

Channel:
- type: Carries values of a type in ChannelValueType
- targets: Neuron[]

Neuron: individual unit of computation
- all neurons have the same
- state: ? array of ChannelValueTypes?
- isBipolar: bool - do we just connect two 
- inputChannels
- outputChannels

Sensor: input channel
- type in ChannelValueType

Region: different collections of neurons

Birth Instructions:
- construct region
- construct cell in region
	- inputs outputs
- connect cells by region:cell index: input+output indicies

Behaviors:
- TEMPLATE: inputs actions target
- inputs: state offset
- outputs: 

DNA
- Birth Instructions: how to initialize cells at birth
	- these would be instructions to assemble cells

- Behaviors

- mutability: bool - can particular gene be mutated or not?

Structure Checker:
- Avoid Cycles - problems.2


Problems:
1. How would the neuron determine which behavior to use? Need to nail down algo...
2. System is has many concurrent moving parts and can have cycles ... difficult to simulate
